## what i do

**fullstack web development**
This is most of my day. Laravel and PHP on the backend, Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind on the frontend. I've worked across enough of the stack to be comfortable wherever the problem is.

**cybersecurity**
Been on Kali Linux for five years. Mostly red team work — HTB machines, CTF competitions, that kind of thing. It's not a separate interest from development, it just changes how I think about what I build.

**algorithmic trading**
I write trading bots and strategies in PineScript, MQL4, MQL5, Python, Rust, and C++. Mostly focused on removing manual decisions from the process and testing whether an idea actually holds up.

**SEO development**
I do this through Next.js. Less about tricks, more about building the structure right from the start so search visibility follows naturally.

**scripting & automation**
Python is probably my most-used language outside of Bash and Zsh. I've done a lot with Selenium, n8n, and custom scripts for automating repetitive tasks — web scraping, YouTube workflows, general ops stuff.

**open source & homelab**
I run HAOS and manage a growing number of integrated devices at home. Most of my non-work tinkering ends up here — automations, device integrations, keeping things self-hosted.
